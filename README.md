Hi there! Here you'll find a bunch of random code from tutorials or interviews I've done over the years, as well as a bunch of (mostly unfinished) side projects. 

Here are a few of the more interesting repos to check out:

 - [Omnibuser](https://github.com/valedan/omnibuser) My first big web app! I learned Ruby on Rails by building this. I was reading a lot of online fiction at the time, and Omnibuser was built to grab a specified story and convert it to a downloadable ebook. It supported a lot of different sites and formats and had some pretty fun engineering challenges! The code is rather horrifying to look back on 6 years later though. Omnibuser was live in production for several years, and had 100 or so daily users during that time.
 - Nutriplan ([frontend](https://github.com/valedan/nutriplan) and [backend](https://github.com/valedan/nutriplan-api)) arose out of my frustration with the lack of good nutritional information in existing meal planning apps. I wanted an app that would let me plan all my food for the week ahead while giving me comprehensive nutritional details, so that I would know if my plan was lacking in some specific micronutrients. I also wanted it to be very easy and quick to use. This was a difficult UX challenge and prompted me to spend a lot of time learning about design and iterating on Figma mockups. It was also a big engineering effort, requiring the wrangling of the huge USDA food database, configuring Elasticsearch, and building a pretty chunky GraphQL API and complex frontend to go with it.
 
 Recently I've been very focused on learning about AI safety, and ramping up on machine learning. I'm open to opportunities or conversations in either of those areas!
